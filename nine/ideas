how many ways to use 9 can I think of tonight?

    base 9 -- nice in a lot of ways -- probably unpleasant in others

    the fact that it's 3squared is significant -- use it by making
    three groups of three a fundamental thing -- sometimes concepts
    will be "forced" into these groupings, but often it may be more
    natural than our usual binary thinking -- also in this way, we
    could perhaps not go "full base 9" but instead count these units
    of 9 in decimal


    trying to use the 9 thing (at even multiple layers?) all the way
    up the hierarchy of scale, but not necessarily as a "hard"
    constraint -- when modeling something that obviously only has a
    pair of components (instead of three), perhaps I can build a
    structure that can have a non-three (2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10...? also
    singleton should also obviously be allowed) grafted onto that
    specific data tree at whatever level(s) is(are) appropriate


    after all 9 is the high end of human ability to keep that many
    things active in the brain at once (if anyone actually trusts that
    data to be useful; I'm not sure I do really)



'twas a wonderful thing swimming out there on the lake and hearing the
bells from Hotchkiss (Chapel?) toll 9pm -- it really felt like a
message from the past -- probably I'm finding a coincidence where
there is none, but with ententional phenomena, does the validity of
the original inspiration even matter?

it seems to me a very good question to ask (whether we are *biased*
due to our base 10 (decimal) view of the world) -- and maybe 9 isn't
even the correct alternative -- maybe 24 (decimal -- this would be 26
in base 9) or some other value is the better one to use -- I just
think 3 squared is as good as any to try (and the fact that it's so
close to 10 makes me want to check out base 11 (decimal) as well)
