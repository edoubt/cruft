So I'm coming close to wanting to really start a serious project that involves coding.  So the first step of course is picking an actual project.  The only thing that comes to mind presently is my quest to create a universal schema.  I wouldn't mind a project that allows me to do the same thing over and over in different languages (not all of them, after I iterate a few, it'd be sensible to let others follow my lead in porting to even more options).  I'm just not sure what I want to actually create.  It seems that my idea might materialize more as a (very complex?) configuration file rather than an actual system.  But that's OK.  But I also found this particular branch of my current github tree to be rather interesting.  Maybe I should (instead of?  or maybe in addition to?) pursue that organization/ directory and attempt to build it out a little in code (or at least protocode?).
