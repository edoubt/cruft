This paper was developed by Stewart, Manfred Max-Neef and 20 other people over a 3-day period at the Tallberg Forum in 2008. 
By Stewart Wallis and Manfred Max-Neef
 
Principle 1: Designed to meet human needs to improve quality of life
Meeting fundamental human needs
Keeping door open to go beyond fundamental needs
Full spectrum of contribution is valued
Rights and responsibilities
Implications:
Differentiate between satisfiers and needs
New measurement systems
Thinking globally
Rewards for responsibility
Mechanisms:
Alternative currencies
GD happiness
New tax systems
Charter of human responsibilities
 
Principle 2:  Economy is bounded by ecosystem limits
Implications:
We do not erode natural capital
Non renewable stocks will either be recycled or be replaced by renewables
Mechanisms:
We have in place the means to restore eroded natural capital stock
Fully price negative activities
We fully account in price the negative impact of human behaviour
Reward system with incentives to invite good behaviour
 
Principle 3:  Equity for present and future generations
Requires an economic system that is just, participatory, transparent and peaceful
Implications:
Live within planetary boundaries – leave a better world for the future
Directly tackle power distribution within markets and companies
Income should be distributed in a way that does not hinder individuals’ abilities to: 
Achieve a secure, meaningful and ecologically sustainable livelihood
Participate in the economy with their full potential
Mechanisms:
Domestic: 
Free primary/secondary education
College loan payback system
Progressive energy tax
Unified universal health care and portable social insurance
New forms of company structure
Globally: 
Social insurance for globally poor
Migration rights
Transnational deliberation on local/national/global policies
 
Principle 4:  Reverence for life
Moving from an anthropocentric to bio centric perspective
All life as subjects, not objects
Factoring into mystical/spiritual/existential/symbolic/aesthetic value
Implications:
All forms of life part of the economic system - taking into account full cost and value of all forms of life
Ownership needs to be redefined (stewardship)
Recognition of nature as ‘natural investment’ – the value of the ecosystem (stocks, not just flows) and the intangible services these offer
Paying for all the externalities that arise from our activities
Technology only has limited answers e.g.: 
Looking after watershed versus building purification plants
Appreciation of the whole, rather than fragmentation of the whole
Mechanisms:
Financial analysis tools need to include life support systems (e.g. loss of biodiversity for commodity gain)
Revise the indicators that we use to determine value
Revise the concept of the time value of money e.g: 
rain forest an appreciating asset
a dollar today has depreciation tomorrow
Non relevance of national boundaries (e.g. transfrontier parks)
Communities and mineral/biodiversity rights
 
Principle 5:  Flexibility, innovation 
for sustainability, self realisation (for development, not growth)
Implications:
Challenge existing optimisation process
Safeguards needed to keep on right track
Mechanisms:
Continuous learning and improvement
Develop new incentives
Education for open collaboration
