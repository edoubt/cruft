I found this resource early in 2013 posted at http://neweconomicsinstitute.org/publications/five-principles-2020

It's titled: A New Set of Economic Principles â€“ Five Principles for the New Economy by 2020

To repeat some of the stuff from the paper itself:

By Stewart Wallis and Manfred Max-Neef

This paper was developed by Stewart, Manfred Max-Neef and 20 other people over a 3-day period at the Tallberg Forum in 2008.
