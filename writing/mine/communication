Recently I've been pondering communication a lot.  I think what needs
to happen is that we need to "collectively" figure out how to minimize
oppositionalism.  I believe that as humans, it is our natural
tendency to "oppose".  For the most part we've learned how to
override some of our other tendencies (to oppress/enslave), so perhaps
there's hope that we can learn how to communicate in a more tolerant  
open-minded way.  Key to this is understanding that it is possible for
two completely opposing viewpoints to both be completely valid/true.
