So I think I figured out a lot of my own baggage.  It's about how
employment works.  The "value" transferred in specific circumstances
fluctuates drastically.

For some reason, this wild variation of price is more acceptable
(though still dissonance-inducing) with respect to the cost of food,
goods, etc..., but when we understand that labor is rewarded in very
different ways (depending on who is actually undertaking the work, and
the specifics of the process), it really does make me physically
wince.

At one end of the spectrum is the person who performs a task without
an expectation of any explicit payment.  Even a slave might reasonably
expect to be fed.  But we live in a world where it is common for
individuals to volunteer their time.  And I submit there are many
variations.  Some perhaps coercive (where family obligations direct
people to work for another's benefit).

My own utopia imagines everyone choosing their own "work" out of
concern for what most needs doing (and which "projects" have the most
potential value).  Critics will immediately ask who will pick up the
garbage.  Couldn't we all just learn to deal with our own garbage?  I
suspect that gatherers and collecters of garbage would indeed emerge
in such a system (as there's true value lurking in and amongst all
that stuff we toss).
