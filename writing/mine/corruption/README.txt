How do/did tribes deal with corruption?

It seems to me that there's a natural limit to the "degree" of
corruption that is limited by the size of the tribe.

Which then makes corruption potentially more of a problem of scale
than anything else.

A single individual who is completely corrupt, but shares nothing with
any other person (about the nature of the corruption, nor the profits
thereof) is far less of a "threat" to societal stability than
collusion between several corrupt individuals is.

So setting limits in the way people are allowed to collaborate could
perhaps be a partial answer?
