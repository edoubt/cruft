A bunch of interlocking memes here.

Really a very complex system.  Only possible to model as an
interconnected web of complex subsystems.

In any case, I make the decision to move forward with principles (try
to rigorously define my most important principles) and to allow my
goals to emerge out of how I choose to specifically embrace my own
principles.

Education and Communication are powerful tools.  Let us use them.

Specifically, let us begin to think deeply and as completely as
possible about how we play, watch and especially "cheer for" games (of
sport, and all others) in our societies.

Finding ways to play games (and even create other "non-game"
collaborative activities) which teach the players (and any observers)
the right lessons will be a huge step towards educating our next
generation.  And of course when they recreate their own interactive
opportunities (and even newer games), the potential is huge.
