Tolerance within limits.

Promote groups who fundamentally respect others.

 Learn.

 Do.

 Teach.

 Share.

 Listen.

The above is more a circular wheel (to keep repeating) rather than a

And that's it.  Pretty much all the rest of it is about building
stronger connections within various groups (and building those groups
into stronger more robust entities).
