principles to gather my self and others around


We love and respect this planet.

We believe that humankind may be exerting undue pressure on many planetary subsystems (ecosystems and otherwise) due to our somewhat large numbers, as well as our technology and the "footprint" of our collective existences.

We think that it's possible to eventually change the behavior of enough of humankind so as to preserve many currently existing "natural" systems.   We believe this will be a tough challenge, and that in order to succeed, most probably new ways of thinking and coming together (as large communities of humans) will need to be explored and developed.

We do not believe new technologies will always be the correct answer to any problem or question.  We believe careful forethought about which technologies that we choose to develop and how we exactly develop them (and to what extent) is of the utmost importance.

We believe in openness and transparency, but within limits.  Those limits should all be about reasonable individual expectations of privacy, and it is expected that those limits may change over time as we better understand our human/animal instinct for secret keeping.  

We believe in working across boundaries of all types, including national, gender, race, religion, sexual preference, orientation & self-image.  There is one planet.  We are one human species. All other designations are more or less ephemeral.

We explicitly respect those humans working towards living off-planet.  We believe that sharing technology and ideas (and perhaps more) with those in pursuit of that goal can only benefit both earth and the adventurers who want to leave.
