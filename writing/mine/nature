principles to gather my self and others around


We love and respect this planet.

We believe that humankind may be exerting undue pressure on many planetary subsystems (ecosystems and otherwise) due to our somewhat large numbers, as well as our technology the "footprint" of our collective existences.

We think that it's possible to eventually be able to change the behavior of humankind so as to preserve as many currently existing systems as is possible.   We believe this will be a tough challenge, and that in order to succeed, most probably new ways of thinking and coming together (as large communities of humans) will need to be explored and developed.

We explicitly respect those humans working towards living off-planet.  We believe that sharing technology and ideas (and perhaps more) with those in pursuit of that goal can only benefit both earth and the adventurers who want to leave.
