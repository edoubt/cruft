principles to gather my self and others around


We love and respect this planet.

We believe in the usefulness of the scientific method (though we acknowledge there may be significant improvements in the scientific methods used in the future) as a way of helping to direct our action.

We believe that humankind may be exerting undue pressure on many planetary subsystems (ecosystems and otherwise) due to our somewhat large numbers, as well as our technology the "footprint" of our collective existences.

We think that it's possible to eventually change the behavior of enough of humankind so as to preserve many currently existing "natural" systems.   We believe this will be a tough challenge, and that in order to succeed, most probably new ways of thinking and coming together (as large communities of humans) will need to be explored and developed.

We do not believe new technologies will always be the correct answer to any problem or question.  We believe careful forethought about which technologies that we choose to develop and how we exactly develop them (and to what extent) is of the utmost importance.

We believe in working across boundaries of all types, including national, gender, race, religion, sexual preference, orientation & self-image.  There is one planet.  We are one human species. All other designations are more or less ephemeral.

We explicitly respect those humans working towards living off-planet.  We believe that sharing technology and ideas (and perhaps more) with those in pursuit of that goal can only benefit both earth and the adventurers who want to leave.
