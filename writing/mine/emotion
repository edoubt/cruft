strong emotion can override and affect rational thinking

but it's usually not directed, so it'll tend to affect all thinking (not just thinking around the originally emotion-inducing topic)

risk can be very emotional for me -- in many different dimensions -- before an "event" I tend to over-worry and develop a lot of agita -- afterwards, the relief of success can be overwhelming (and the guilt of failure and improper planning (insufficient worrying?) can also be severe)
