There are strong negatives with aggression.  But also significant positives (I believe -- perhaps I'll eventually shift my position on this?).  Let me try to iterate over the positives: 
 * reinforces confidence in self 
 * when under stress (and in a truly desperate situation) this trait may mean the difference for survival (of any species)
 * can be useful in a specific situation to confront an adversary who is participating "unfairly"

And the negatives:
 * violence should be avoided -- aggression is the implied threat of violence (or a direct violent act)
 * at heart it is a coercive strategy -- this is *not* something that we want to become widespread in society
 * in the end, there is perhaps something "false" or inadequate about self-confidence that is gained via aggression 

So does this mediate towards tolerating aggression in our children more than we do in adults?  Perhaps.  But I think that we want to tolerate a certain (hopefully very low) level of aggression in our society(ies).


Instinctively, aggression seems to be a short-cut to self-confidence (a very clever strategy produced by evolution to bootstrap our sense of "self")
