At first I thought maybe there's no use for guilt.  But then I realized that it's (at least partially) what keeps me monogamous.  If it weren't for the incredible anticipation of guilt (among other reasons), perhaps I'd be tempted to give in to my biological urges to have sex with other attractive females beyond my wife.
