Mostly negative.  Any possible positive has to do with the "ambition" aspect of a person who is exhibiting strong grasping.


Instinctively, this is a tool with which a self bootstraps identity/self-confidence.  By each of us assembling a coherent ecosystem of "things" around us (which ideally becomes (or happens in) our home), we can each strengthen our own sense of identity (and create a "comfort zone" in which we are able to relax (and gives us a needed sense of "control").

Perhaps this should be tolerated more in children.  In adults, I think perhaps strong grasping will always be seen as a sign of weakness (by the people whose opinion I value most).  Though it seems to me that capitalism is based on the universality of greed.
