I'd say about equally positive and negative (at least historically).

The negative is that strong fear tends to limit our decision-making choices.  This is also a positive (when fear keeps us from doing truly dangerous things).

Instinctively, this is a necessary tool for any higher organism.  It provides part of the default basis for learning (and allows the bootstrap of self to take place). 

Thanks much to Erin for pointing out that fear is far more "basic" (I like the term "primal") and far less "interchangeable" than many other emotions.  In fact, I'm not sure that fear is an emotion (though reaction to it certainly is).
