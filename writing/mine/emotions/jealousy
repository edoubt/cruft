In my estimation, there is only a small potential for positivity, in that motivation can be created from jealousy.  Still, the negatives, even in a situation where someone is strongly motivated, are significant (and may outweigh any potential positives).


Instinctively, where does jealousy come from?  I'm not actually sure it's an instict.  Could it be entirely social/learned behavior?
