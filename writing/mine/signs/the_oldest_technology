I think a good claim can be made for signs being the oldest of all
technologies.  Animals leave signs for each other, and even plants do
as well, so this is not necessarily the first "human only" technology
(organized warfare may get that dubious honor).  Even fire isn't human
only (some pine (and/or maybe spruce -- bristlecone, etc...) trees
leverage it as well, so not certain why that matters.  But I want to
be clear enough about my claim since it involves a "first".

Many species in our ecosystems use signs to communicate both with
other members of their own species (for sexual reproduction and
territoriality concerns) and also other species.  Any (proficient)
hunter will be able to explain in far more detail than I'm able about
the importance of "reading sign(s)" while out tracking quarry.

Our human use of intentional signs to each other though exceeds the
"natural" predecessors long used by many species.  Even far before
written language (probably written language may have been prompted by
ancestors who wished for more explicit signs and found a way to create
them by bringing formalized "writing" into being).
