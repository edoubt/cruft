I'm starting from the position that there are 2 completely different
orders of magnitude for value.

The first (lower) one is that usual one we associate with a dollar (or
whatever currency is relevant) amount.  This is always necessary.
Because almost always food, shelter, and sometimes water, protection,
etc... need to be "purchased" from someone.

But the 2nd (higher) level of value is from a deep connection.  True
love or true friendship.  Or what has in the past been referred to as
kinship.  This one can't be bought and sold (or not nearly as
easily/efficiently as more tangible products/services).


Recognizing this reality (and sharing/spreading the meme) seems to me
to be a good idea.
