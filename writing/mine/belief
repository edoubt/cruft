Dr. S told me that I had a problem distinguishing belief from facts,
an insight that I badly needed to hear and understand at the time.

I've been thinking a lot about this.  _Incomplete Nature_ and other
books and articles I've read recently have helped me to understand
that within my own brain, it can be very hard to discern one from the
other.

Is it a reasonable answer to say that there are no facts, only
beliefs?  In some sense, this avoids the problem.  And by labeling
thoughts as beliefs (instead of facts), this explicitly allows for the
possibility of future change (whereas learning that a fact is not as
"true" as I once thought creates some "extra" cognitive dissonance as
I attempt to resolve things).

Cromwell's rule is really helpful here: probabilities of 0 and 1
should be avoided unless one is operating in a purely logical
domain/environment.

The power of belief(s) is of course that it is sometimes possible to
instantiate them in the real world (as facts).  I smell
ententionality.
