So a few weeks ago, Obama was asked about this new Pope, and he
mentioned that pretty much all religions have some version of the
golden rule.  This made me think a lot about the golden rule.  My
first conclusion is how "unnatural" it is.  In the sense that if one
is truly optimizing for onesself, it makes a lot more sense to cheat
and kill other people when the opportunity arises (there's less risk
with that route anyhow).  But of course society mitigates against
this.  Perhaps this is society's ultimate goal: to promote
cooperation.
