perhaps use ../trajectory as a start (or maybe even half?)

games and how we play them (and how we treat rules) is really the key

ideally rules should be somewhat fluid depending on local circumstances

can rules for such activity work? definitely we'll need to add another
degree or two of complexity to our ruleset




natural state of tribal humans was in a smallish group (hundreds at
most of people one would daily interact with)

how we react to strangers is key -- we want to be as tolerant as possible

we also need to understand that the lack of predators to threaten us
threatens us -- the relief of the constraint (that very few humans
(almost none) are eaten by wild animals in 2013) is a victory in some
sense, but we need to realize that the hubris this engenders is far
more dangerous than animals that only ever seriously threatened small
fractions of our human populations, even before we exterminated most
of them
