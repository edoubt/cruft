Initially I started with the    nature   file but when I shared it with Onarcy
I realized it wasn't nearly as universally appealing as I'd hoped.  So then 
the quest was on to try to succeed at something more universal.  And now 
  s0   is the latest attempt to define membership in society (not in a very 
rigorous way, but specifically from the point of view of each member).  The
  society   file contains some more thinking on how I'm trying to go about
this task.
