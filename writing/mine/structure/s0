an attempt to iterate over principles few could quibble with (though almost certainly not all will adopt either)



We seek to live in harmony with other people and the natural world.

We understand that we have emotional urges as a result of human
evolution in the tribal hunter-gatherer past of our ancestors.  We
will work hard to override the negative urges and collectively use
societal standards (and the support of our close friends/family if
available) as a support network to help us all achieve this goal.

We understand that personal freedom is essential.

We understand that there may come a time when society (or a smaller
group) will act in a coercive and/or restrictive way towards
individuals who are working against the best interests of human
society.

We understand that humans are social beings and we support the 
efforts of anyone attempting to connect individuals in any way.
