I think I want to try to build a file similar to
the nature file in this same directory.  But without
any aspect of the planet mentioned at all.  Just 
all about voluntarily joining up with other humans.

The ultimate "opt-in" choice.

But I'm not yet ready to start working on it, so
this placeholder will serve to remind me that I 
want to at whatever point in the future I become

OK, beginning to work :-] So the thing is that most people are making
some sort of implicit deal with society.  I think my goal here may be

have principles.  Perhaps I should also create more cynical documents
describing a more "actual" or realistic explicit deal one of us humans
may have with the rest of society.

Not sure what the goal is though.  I guess it has to do with groups.
And my seeing principles as what groups are best founded around.  But
