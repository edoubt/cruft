I contend that we must understand/embrace/deal-with risk in order to
become fully self-actualized.

In some ways risk is an ends in itself, as successful (repeated)
navigation is a very useful tool to build confidence with.  And
because our perception is necessarilly shaped by our minds, that leads
to the conclusion that our view of risk will always be an estimate
whose accuracy varies widely over different domains.

I personally have a magnified internal image now of the risk of
vehicular accidents (for me, my family and loved ones).  And that
"magnified" is with respect to how I used to think; I'm not sure it's
innapproriate.

Whenever a lot of relative energy/momentum is involved (anywhere in
the real world), there's the potential for catastrophic destruction
and/or loss of life.  And of course the level of "how catastrophic" is
directly linked to how much energy.

Personal risk is an interesting thing.  My assumptions that come from
emotional sources are rarely based on rationality (in terms of
statistical risk).  Risks that I *like* (because they invigorate me
when I take them) may in fact seriously be dangerous.  And yet I'm
afraid of other things (often involving unknowns) that may merit
little concern (because of the extreme improbability of their
occurrence).
