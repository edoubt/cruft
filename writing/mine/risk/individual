I contend that we must understand/embrace/deal-with risk in order to become fully self-actualized.

In some ways risk is an ends in itself, as successful (repeated) navigation is a very useful tool to build confidence with.  And because our perception is necessarilly shaped by our minds, that leads to the conclusion that our view of risk will always be an estimate whose accuracy varies widely over different domains.

I personally have a magnified internal image now of the risk of vehicular accidents (for me, my family and loved ones).  And that "magnified" is with respect to how I used to think; I'm not sure it's innapproriate.

Whenever a lot of relative energy/momentum is involved (anywhere in the real world), there's the potential for catastrophic destruction and/or loss of life.  And of course the level of "how catastrophic" is directly linked to how much energy.
