So many folks seem to be so completely consumed with the idea of
privacy.  But we are a social species, and so communication is part of
who we are.  Sometimes I wonder if what people *really* want when they
*say* they want privacy is actually the ability to practice deception.
Perhaps I'm being overly harsh and focussing too narrowly, but it
seems that true privacy is far too dependent on the actions of others
(those "friends" with which you've shared secrets) to have much base
in reality at all.  I suppose I lie on the cynical side of things, but
my take on it is that any information that's truly important will be
shared with others (despite all sorts of attempts at protocols,
procedures, oaths, promises, etc...).  So why bother?
