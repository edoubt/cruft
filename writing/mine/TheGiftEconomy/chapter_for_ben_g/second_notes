There's still a lot of information that I have written and haven't checked in.  Not because I think that anyone's even monitoring this repo right now, but rather because I just don't want to take the chance that someone else gives me input.  I just want to bang on some of these concepts alone.

What I am willing to do now is to try to give the general outline of the chapter I'm trying to write (or the latest draft anyhow...)

I want to mostly argue against control and domination and point out how the capitalist paradigm has essentially enabled a small number of individuals to exert way too much control over everyone's life.

I don't have all the solutions to this dilemma (current powerful entrenched interests unwilling to cede control) but I think a very important one is how play games.  I advocate creating new games that intentionally reward creativity and cooperation.

We also need to protect the earth from capitalism.  Rather than optimizing for wealth, we should be optimizing for long-term sustainability.

Thinking as parents is a very effective way to look at the future.
