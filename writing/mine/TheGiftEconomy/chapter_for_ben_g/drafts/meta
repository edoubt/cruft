As I hit a (hopefully slight?) patch of writer's block it occurs to me that perhaps I'm writing (and thinking) these thoughts mainly for my own benefit.  At the moment, I'm very much in the thick of control and domination.  Maybe this is an exercise about giving myself permission to participate in (hopefully somewhat limited) control and domination (of the people in our society).  I still hold an allure for anarchy, but I'm trying to decide if that's a naive (and impractical) viewpoint.  With so many of us humans on the planet, there really *has* to be a framework that constrains our individual actions somewhat.  And, yeah, most of the limits can be set internally by all of us individual humans, but the statistical reality (that there are billions of us) means that there ultimately need to be restraints set as a group (and imposed on most of us by others).  I'm not sure how useful to others any of these thoughts are, so I think I want to try to keep moving in the direction I've been trying to go and write more about games.  That's after all where much of my development of ideas like constraints, boundaries, rules, laws, etc... has come out of.  I guess I need to try to figure out how to address that issue (rather than getting hung up on it as I currently am).
