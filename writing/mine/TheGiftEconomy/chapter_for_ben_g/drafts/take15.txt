Life is just a Game.  ~Stanley Clark (among others)

definition -- a game is an activity with rules that some people enjoy "playing"

rules, boundaries and constraints

our penchant for pushing against the rules (and finding loopholes, exceptions or just simply ways to cheat)


The real trick here is finding an arc that will tie this all together in a nice story.  So for the moment, that's job 1.


any game can be looked at across many different dimensions (sport, field/boundaries, ruleset, risk of physical injury, etc....)

the more I ponder these things, the more I think understanding and coping with risk is the real trick



So there are two obivous choices:
  1.  Start writing about specific games.

  2.  Lay my cards on the table at the beginning (that I believe almost every process can be considered a game) and then develop that explicitly with examples.


I think I like 1. better.
