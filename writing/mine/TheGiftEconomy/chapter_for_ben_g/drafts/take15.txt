Life is just a Game.  ~Stanley Clark (among others)

definition -- a game is an activity with rules that some people enjoy "playing"

rules, boundaries and constraints

our penchant for pushing against the rules (and finding loopholes, exceptions or just simply ways to cheat)


The real trick here is finding an arc that will tie this all together in a nice story.  So for the moment, that's job 1.


any game can be looked at across many different dimensions (sport, field/boundaries, ruleset, risk of physical injury, etc....)
