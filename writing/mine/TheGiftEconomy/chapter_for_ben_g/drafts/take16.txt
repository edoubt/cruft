As a child, I was an absolute lover of games.  My dad taught me to play poker before I was 5.  I also loved other card games (canasta, blackjack, a bunch of different versions of solitaire) as well as sports of all types (basketball, baseball, football, hockey, soccer, volleyball, etc...).  There is something comforting about having the same set of rules apply to all players.  I realize now that one of the main reasons for this appeal is that one doesn't get the same benefit in life.  Different people get vastly different treatment in life.  



I think it's useful to look at how rules apply in games.  Some games have referees or umpires making certain decisions (and helping with enforcement of the rules).  But other games rely on the players themselves to enforce the rules without any "impartial" individual to help.
