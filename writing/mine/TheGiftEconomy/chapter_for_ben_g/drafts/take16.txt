As a child, I was an absolute lover of games.  My dad taught me to play poker before I was 5.  I understood the rules pretty quickly (even the implicit rule of the necessity of hiding one's reaction to one's own hand).  I also loved other card games (blackjack, pitch, canasta, and a bunch of other different versions of solitaire) as well as sports of all types (basketball, baseball, football, hockey, soccer, volleyball, etc...).  There is something comforting about having the same set of rules apply to all players.  I realize now that one of the main reasons for this appeal is that one doesn't get the same benefit in life.  Different people get vastly different treatment in life.  

But games can teach us everything we need to know.  I propose that life is a game on many levels simultaneously.  

I think it's useful to look at how rules apply in games.  Some games have referees or umpires making certain decisions (and helping with enforcement of the rules).  But other games rely on the players themselves to enforce the rules without any "impartial" individual to help.  One of my favorite games, ultimate (see http://www.upa.org/ ) is a team sport that has no outside enforcement beyond the participating players (though in 2005 the presence of impartial "observers" has been brought into some of the highest levels of competition, I play with a group of people who follow the original rules).  By the way, the rules to ultimate are fairly complex.  There are 19 sections (in the current 11th edition of the rules), each of which has a significant amount of detail.  But the real brilliance is the "spirit of the game" rule, which is very meta.  From the 11th edition: 

Spirit of the Game: Ultimate relies upon a spirit of sportsmanship that places the responsibility for fair play on the player. Highly competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of mutual respect among competitors, adherence to the agreed upon rules, or the basic joy of play. Protection of these vital elements serves to eliminate unsportsmanlike conduct from the Ultimate field. Such actions as taunting opposing players, dangerous aggression, belligerent intimidation, intentional infractions, or other "win-at-all-costs" behavior are contrary to the spirit of the game and must be avoided by all players.

As far as humanity's past, I believe that our minds have evolved to excel at games and puzzles.  I will dwell on the two primary mechanisms.  First off, the task of surviving (and thriving) to maturity and pairing in order to mate has a lot of game-like qualities.  It's quite a complicated process, as both partners are actively seeking to provide the best genes for their offspring (driven by our brains, which were designed by evolution).  I found Matt Ridley's book _The Red Queen_ held a lot of insights on this topic.  The second gamelike mechanism in our human past history is the task of procuring enough good food.  Early on, we were hunter/gatherers.  Both of those tasks are very gamelike (in hunting, we've even come to label our target quarry with the same name: game).  And it seems very obvious to me that efficiently locating and gathering berries, nuts or whatever else is available is also very game- or puzzle-like.

In my opinion, the problem comes with capitalism explicitly.  Not that there isn't an awful lot of positive that has come from capitalism, but I think it's worth acknowledging its weaknesses.  The elephant in the room is that capitalism encourages everyone to optimise for "value." And in capitalist systems, value gets definied in monetary terms, which is not always appropriate, as true value is more than the price one pays for something. Sometimes the two are closely related, other times not so much.  And the model encourages each actor in the system to perceive the system as a zero-sum-game, thereby explicitly permitting exploitation of other humans (and the environment, etc...) as a valid strategy that is supposed to have a Darwinian effect on the whole kit and kaboodle, promoting the strong and somehow "weeding out" the weak, yada, yada, yada.  I think most of that is bullshit.  Yes, competitiveness can breed quality.  But it can (and does) also create dominance of a few over many and a ridiculous pursuit of secrecy (because knowledge itself is seen as an "asset" to guard and hold on to so that exploitation can continue longer).  And the argument that those who've made a lot of money are better qualified to make decisions for the rest of us (which they absolutely do today, due to the inherent corruption of this aggregation of power) is very hollow, and easily defeated.  

Many team sports (and individual competetive games) encourage "zero sum" thinking, i.e. the only way I (or my team) can win is if the other person (or team) loses.  Capitalism also encourages this way of thinking, allowing (and even encouraging) the exploitation of the weak (whether as labor or consumers).  I don't personally believe that reality is like that.  Any given group of people will be able to accomplish more when they cooperate than they could if they each strive alone as individuals.    

Let's make the real game of life more enjoyable.  We can do this by creating better games.  Another way to say this is that we need to examine our world and our societies and try to figure out where we humans are doing well and where we could use improvement.  Much of science can be utilized in this examination/analysis.  Looking at our daily behavior with an eye towards reducing destructive and/or polluting consequences is a good aim.  Creating specific game-like "goals" that support these future "meta" goals would seem to me a productive endeavor.  

Bitcoin is almost a perfect game.  The one thing that I would say is less than ideal is the "mining" process.  Not that it's bad, but it does encourage energy to be consumed in order to generate coins.  The task that the bitcoin creator(s) chose is to set miners to look for sequences of characters that, when hashed with SHA-256, produce resulting hashes with a certain number of leading zeros.  This is a computationally intensive process (and so there's no way to "cheat" other than to bring more computing resources to bear).  As far as I can tell, there is no possible "benefit" external to the bitcoin process of finding these rare strings which SHA-256 hash to values with leading zeros.  I don't have anywhere near a deep understanding of the details of bitcoin, but if it were possible to create a similar "digital currency" where the computational goal is one with external value (perhaps searching for cures for diseases, or efficient algorithms, or ...) then this resulting "game" would be almost perfect.  Of course, I have no reason to be sure that such an "improved" bitcoin is even possible, but the very existence of bitcoin in its present form is something that very few of us would have predicted (or believed possible).  At this point in time (2013) the bitcoin miners who are succeeding are battling with electrical power cost and efficiency (the competition has gotten so intense, and so many people are trying to mine bitcoins).  And so the "energy" being consumed for this purpose is no longer insignificant (and any energy consumed for this purpose (and associated pollution generated from power production where fossil fuels are being burned to generate that electricity)) and to some degree is "wasted" as we humans won't get any direct benefit from the "consumption" of energy other than more bitcoins. 

Efficiency can be a game, i.e. trying to optimize for some specific (or multiple) dimension(s).  Let me give a concrete example.  I accept implicitly (and have for some time) the goal of "reuse, repurpose, recycle".  This is a specifically ordered sequence too.  For those of you who may not be familiar with it, the idea is to try to reduce the "waste" stream of households/businesses/etc..., as any of those three options will remove part of the load on landfills/incinerators/etc...   The order is important, because continued reuse of something is the ideal solution (because it also takes a load off of manufacturing new objects of this type).  One way I personally "win" this game is that I rarely throw out milk jugs anymore.  Instead I wash them (with cold water, that's sufficient if the milk hasn't spoiled in the jug).  I then take the milk jugs down to my greenhouse. (I built one in my back yard, an impulse that I would also argue was game-driven, as I'm now able to provide greens for myself and my family in the winter that are fresh (and mostly cost me my own labor, which is a labor of love as well).  My greenhouse is only heated by the sun, and those 1 gallon milk jugs filled with water collect that energy quite effectively when placed on shelves in my greenhouse.  Now I don't expect that this particular solution will go very far.  Probably relatively few people are able (and interested in?) build(ing) a greenhouse in their backyard.  But everyone can make up their own efficiency games that work for them (and share them with others -- perhaps some of you do have greenhouses and might now choose to implement my "milk jug" solution to capturing solar energy).

In some ways, every job I've ever held in my life has been a game.  The object is to satisfy my boss(es) so that I don't get fired.  And there's of course the "meta" goal of needing to decide whether I can go find another job playing a game that's more fun (and hopefully pays more).  Much of my work recently with technology involves actively troublshooting complex problems, and designing building systems, all of which are very gamelike activities as well.  In fact, working outdoors on a farm really involved essentially the same thing.  Though the complexity of the problems I was asked to solve as a farmhand was significantly less.  Were I the owner or "manager" of a farm (rather than just a "worker"), that might not be true.  In my "gamelike" view of things, I wonder if it wouldn't make for a very satisfying way of living if everyone had not just 1, but rather many (at least a dozen or so) different jobs that we all work at (and derive income/value from).  The preconceptions about what "full-time" work is seem to be a serious impediment to working towards that solution.

But I think that we should all do work that we like.  I think that the performance of everyone would be universally higher (on average, I admit for the possibility of exceptions, but I suspect they would be very few).

When considering any game, here are some important "dimensions" to consider:   

 Ruleset size/complexity
The number (and complexity) of rules will vary from game to game.  All other things being equal, I'm of the opinion that fewer (and simpler) rules are better.  But there is a tradeoff here.  Some very good games have fairly complex rulesets, so this is not a dimension that should ultimately be optimized for at the expense of the other dimensions.

 Enforcement mechanism(s)
Relying on external enforcement (referees, umpires, etc...) is not as good as allowing a game to be self-enforced.  The key here is that one wants the enforcement mechanism to encourage the players to be completely honest 100% of the time.  This crosses over from the "explicit" rules in many games to the "meta" concept of sportsmanship.  And it's probably an ideal that will never be reached.  No matter how "pure" any game is, it's probably not hard to find someone who has tried to cheat at that particular game.  Obviously, the mental baggage that each player brings with her/him from her/his previous life experiences will have a great effect here as well.  As with the first dimension above, there is really no way to attain total perfection on this dimension.  But there is a minimum threshhold of "fairness" that all players must embrace (and which is generated by their understanding of and confidence in the enforcement mechanism(s)) in order for a game to be attractive to potential players.  
To some degree, relying on external enforcement of the rules (rather than allowing them to be self-enforced) encourages players to "selectively" follow the rules (i.e. only when they feel they are being observed by the referee(s)) if it will potentially give them an advantage.  The answer of "more referees" (to try to insure that nobody can do anything unobserved) doesn't seem to be a great answer to me.   As the "societal" non-game goal would naturally then be a total panopticon.  I'm much more in favor of inculcating personal responsibility and trusting individuals to do the right thing (as opposed to growing police/security forces to the point where they're capable of enforcing standards of behavior for every human everywhere).

 Goal alignment (with truly useful endeavors)
This is the big one.  Where I think we've only barely scratched the surface so far.  I think that taking societal goals and building games around them has huge potential.  Let's make energy efficiency more of a game.  Many mundane tasks can be made more "game-like".  

 Cooperativeness
Others may disagree, but I think this is a pretty pure dimension.  Which is to say that the more cooperation is encouraged, the better the game.  There can still be games that are very good and useful which don't encourage cooperation, but with the way that our planet is connected, it seems quite obvious to me that there are many possibilities for creating games which encourage us to work together.  

 Competetiveness
To some degree, every game has a competetive aspect (if there were no challenge, there would be no game), but it's important to realize that some games encourage competetiveness more than others.  As the paradigm that has brough us to this point (natural selection) is based on competition, I won't try to argue that it's a negative.   And many may disagree with me.  But that's fine.  My own predilection is to look to create games which are not solely hyperfocused on the competition aspect.  Others may create highly competetive games that have many positive benefits (we already have a bunch of these of course) and that's fine.


I believe that some of the most important "work" of the future is the continued creation and "tuning" of new games.   And I encourage people to think outside the box in order to create games that interact with real concerns (and try to help solve real problems that have traditionally been "outside" the realm of games & play).  It's really important to look at games with regard to the strategies they engender.  Games that naturally encourage cooperation (and punish "self-centered" thinking) are capable of building patterns in our minds that will extend to other non-game human interactions.

Relatively simple rules can generate an amazing degree of complexity.  I'm speaking now in terms of 



It's OK not to like a particular game.  I'm not very fond of golf, but I try to be tolerant of all the beautiful real estate that golf courses use up.  And I take some solace in the fact that at least golfers (and spectators) are interacting with the "real world" in a visceral way.  My answer is that we should just have a lot of games to choose from.  And let us all play the ones we want.
