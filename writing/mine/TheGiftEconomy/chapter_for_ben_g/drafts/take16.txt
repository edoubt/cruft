As a child, I was an absolute lover of games.  My dad taught me to play poker before I was 5.  I also loved other card games (canasta, blackjack, a bunch of different versions of solitaire) as well as sports of all types (basketball, baseball, football, hockey, soccer, volleyball, etc...).  There is something comforting about having the same set of rules apply to all players.  I realize now that one of the main reasons for this appeal is that one doesn't get the same benefit in life.  Different people get vastly different treatment in life.  



I think it's useful to look at how rules apply in games.  Some games have referees or umpires making certain decisions (and helping with enforcement of the rules).  But other games rely on the players themselves to enforce the rules without any "impartial" individual to help.


As far as humanity's past, I believe that our minds have evolved to excel at games and puzzles.  I will dwell on the two primary mechanisms.  First off, the task of surviving (and thriving) to maturity and pairing in order to mate has a lot of game-like qualities.  It's quite a complicated process, as both partners are actively seeking to provide the best genes for their offspring (driven by our brains, which were designed by evolution).  I found Matt Ridley's book _The Red Queen_ held a lot of insights on this topic.  The second gamelike mechanism in our human past history is the task of providing enough good food.  Early on, we were hunter/gatherers.  Both of those tasks are very gamelike (in hunting, we've even come to label our target quarry with the same name: game).

The problem comes

Let's make the real game of life more enjoyable.  We can do this by creating better games.  Another way to say this is that we need to examine our world and our societies and try to figure out where we humans are doing well and where we could use improvement.  Much of science can be utilized in this examination/analysis.  Looking at our daily behavior with an eye towards reducing destructive and/or polluting consequences is a good aim.  Creating specific game-like "goals" that support these future "meta" goals would seem to me a productive endeavor.  

Bitcoin as a game.
