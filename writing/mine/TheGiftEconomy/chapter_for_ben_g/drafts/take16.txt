As a child, I was an absolute lover of games.  My dad taught me to play poker before I was 5.  I understood the rules pretty quickly (even the implicit rule of the necessity of hiding one's reaction to one's own hand).  I also loved other card games (canasta, blackjack, a bunch of different versions of solitaire) as well as sports of all types (basketball, baseball, football, hockey, soccer, volleyball, etc...).  There is something comforting about having the same set of rules apply to all players.  I realize now that one of the main reasons for this appeal is that one doesn't get the same benefit in life.  Different people get vastly different treatment in life.  

But games can teach us everything we need to know.  I propose that life is a game on many levels simultaneously.  

I think it's useful to look at how rules apply in games.  Some games have referees or umpires making certain decisions (and helping with enforcement of the rules).  But other games rely on the players themselves to enforce the rules without any "impartial" individual to help.  One of my favorite games, ultimate (see http://www.upa.org/ ) is a team sport that has no outside enforcement beyond the participating players (though in 2005 the presence of impartial "observers" has been brought into some of the highest levels of competition, I play with a group of people who follow the original rules).  By the way, the rules to ultimate are fairly complex.  There are 19 sections (in the current 11th edition of the rules), each of which has a significant amount of detail.  

As far as humanity's past, I believe that our minds have evolved to excel at games and puzzles.  I will dwell on the two primary mechanisms.  First off, the task of surviving (and thriving) to maturity and pairing in order to mate has a lot of game-like qualities.  It's quite a complicated process, as both partners are actively seeking to provide the best genes for their offspring (driven by our brains, which were designed by evolution).  I found Matt Ridley's book _The Red Queen_ held a lot of insights on this topic.  The second gamelike mechanism in our human past history is the task of providing enough good food.  Early on, we were hunter/gatherers.  Both of those tasks are very gamelike (in hunting, we've even come to label our target quarry with the same name: game).

The problem comes

Let's make the real game of life more enjoyable.  We can do this by creating better games.  Another way to say this is that we need to examine our world and our societies and try to figure out where we humans are doing well and where we could use improvement.  Much of science can be utilized in this examination/analysis.  Looking at our daily behavior with an eye towards reducing destructive and/or polluting consequences is a good aim.  Creating specific game-like "goals" that support these future "meta" goals would seem to me a productive endeavor.  

Bitcoin as a game.

Efficiency can be a game, i.e. trying to optimize for some specific (or multiple) dimension(s).  Let me give a concrete example.  I accept implicitly (and have for some time) the goal of "reuse, repurpose, recycle".  This is a specifically ordered sequence too.  For those of you who may not be familiar with it, the idea is to try to reduce the "waste" stream of households/businesses/etc..., as any of those three options will remove part of the load on landfills/incinerators/etc...   The order is important, because continued reuse of something is the ideal solution (because it also takes a load off of manufacturing new objects of this type).  One way I personally "win" this game is that I rarely throw out milk jugs anymore.  Instead I wash them (with cold water, that's sufficient if the milk hasn't spoiled in the jug).  I then take the milk jugs down to my greenhouse. (I built one in my back yard, an impulse that I would also argue was game-driven, as I'm now able to provide greens for myself and my family in the winter that are fresh (and mostly cost me my own labor, which is a labor of love as well).  My greenhouse is only heated by the sun, and those 1 gallon milk jugs filled with water collect that energy quite effectively when placed on shelves in my greenhouse.  Now I don't expect that this particular solution will go very far.  Probably relatively few people are able (and interested in?) build(ing) a greenhouse in their backyard.  But everyone can make up their own efficiency games that work for them (and share them with others -- perhaps some of you do have greenhouses and might now choose to implement my "milk jug" solution to capturing solar energy).

It's OK not to like a particular game.  I'm not very fond of golf, but I try to be tolerant of all the beautiful real estate that golf courses use up. My answer is that we should just have a lot of games to choose from.  And let us all play the ones we want.
