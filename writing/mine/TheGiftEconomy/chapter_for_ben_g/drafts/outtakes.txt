I also think that we need each other to help keep us "honest".  By leading more open transparent lives.  It's the softer side of enforcement.  By collectively expressing our displeasure to the bad behavior of others, most folks might have incentive to change their ways.  But if we honor some arbitrary standard of "privacy" (such that what takes place out of site behind a wall, fence, hillside, etc... can never be discovered by outsiders) then we will always be subject to the pecadillos of individual crazy folk.
