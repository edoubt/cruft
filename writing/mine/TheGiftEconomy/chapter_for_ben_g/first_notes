Starting to type in some of my longhand scribblings from a composition notebook I've been carrying around with me for a few months now.

     Pure and true value is created 
     note at the expense of other people animals nor
     the environment, but rather as a way of "lifting
     all boats" as a rising tide does.


     Maintenenance of tools, instruments, machines,
     shelter, etc... is somewhat (though not 
     completely) analagous to the responsibility that comes
     with ownership/care of animals (or even children).

<page 5> 

     Rigor


     Ownership is a compromise
         that doesn't really treat the universe 
	 with the respect it deserves.  Rather the 
	 whole idea is too heavily weighted toward
	 an anthropocentric (or at least individualistic)
	 view.


     But nevertheless I am going to assume that the
     concept of ownership will continue to hold sway in much
     of human society for the next few years, decades and/or 
     centuries.

     My goal is to advance the tenet that 
     ownership might better be reframed as responsibility.  If
     human society (and most of the individuals who make up
     our society) can embrace that idea, I believe that 
     much unneeded suffering can be avoided.

<page 6>  (still blank)

<page 7> 
  Ownership has changed significantly in 
society.  Once, ownership of human beings (slaves)
was part of the definition.   Now that's mostly 
not true, though there is still some association
with children (inversely related to age).  It is here
we can say that society has already started down the
path to a more enlightened way of thinking, as many
of us feel responsible for our children (and don't see
them as chattels).

  My goal is to optimize society in terms
of the objects we create








  As far as the information that we create, it's far
trickier to decide what we should be optimizing for.
  Though due to how hard it is (even for an indiviual,
much less for a whole society of people) to _unlearn_ anything,
perhaps the answer is to be far more careful (with respect
to information sharing) on certain topics (research into weapons
comes to mind).  On the other hand, many tools can become weapons


<page 8> blank

<page 9> 
  I think then that extending this care to
try to create a culture such that everyone understands
that each tool needs to be respected (and knowledge
about how to acquire skill using that tool needs to be 
gathered, maintained and updated by a group of experts
who are also morally equipped to handle that
role.

OK I really need to narrow down 
my focus.  Gifts + value + cost + ownership
+ energy is just way too much to try to 
cover completely in a single chapter.
  But I really have no clue how to whittle
it down.  Perhaps though I'm trying to solve
the wrong problem.  Maybe I should just
start writing and go from there.

  My original idea was really a frustration
with how the words value and cost had 
been corrupted by our socio-economic system.
  In my own mind the attributes of value and
cost had a "pure" instrinsic meaning.  And
the "dollar values" for things that I was familiar
with didn't correspond to my own opinions.

 The fact that I disagree with most of 
my society on this issue makes the battle
to convince you all quite a bit like tipping
at windmills, but nevertheless I feel that the
issue is important enough that I do need to make
an attempt to share my thoughts.

 And my thoughts are not "finished" and so I 
welcome collaboration as I work at developing them.

Two more issues related to value.  Potential
+ Time.
  Time gets traded for value in a very variable way.
Each person's time is "worth" a different amount (to
that person) and time doing different activities may
vary in value for a single individual

  It's far "easier" to use power to destroy
rather than create.  Which means that
if we are to be completely free and open with
all of our information, we will necessarily be at
the mercy fo the frings elements of our society, especially
the mentally unstable.

  In a purely cooperative ecosystem, what is lost
is the "competetive edge" of a truly alive, dynamic,
real ecosystem:  the pruning effect from selfish
actors "stealing" someone else's efforts


  Perhaps we should use the dual (particle-wave)
view of matter as a metaphor.  Similarly human
motivation has a dual nature.  The semmingly contradictory
ideas of selfish vs. cooperative motivation can perhaps
be brought together.  As humans who live in large
societies, we must consider our effect on the society if
we have any hope for our progeny.

We now have the power to decide who we
work for and where and how we spend our money.

We are a creature that naturally forms groups.

Evolutionarily, those groups were families + tribes.

Historically, we developed strategies for defining and
improving those groups which were based on
exclusion.  That is, the group is not only defined
by its membership, but also by who is _not_
in the tribe, and is therefore considered inferior and
less worthy of compassion by the members of the tribe.

  My plea is to those who currently don't struggle to 
survive.  People who are hustling to provide enough
basic sustenance and shelter for themselves and their
families don;'t necessarilly have the luxury of any 
choice.  They must take whatever employment they
can find.  But the rest of us do have a lot of 
choices.  I encourage everyone to treat
the entire planet as out most important tribe.  And 
to join + work for groups that reject exclusivity.
  We can create and sustain more large institutions/foundations

<page 24>
that do far more good than governments
and corporations.
  We should see not only every human 
on the planet as a member of our tribe,
but even every fellow member of the
ecosystem that produced us.

There is value in competition.  It almost 
always creates a honing or strengthening effect.
So the trick is to find balance.  Between
self-interest (which drives competition) and cooperation.

It is ok to compete with each other when 
the stakes don't involve life or health.
  Creating competetive environments tuned
to deal in prices/penalties that are beyond 
basic needs is a worthwhile goal.
