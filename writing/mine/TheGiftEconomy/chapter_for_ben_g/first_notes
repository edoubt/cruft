Starting to type in some of my longhand scribblings from a composition notebook I've been carrying around with me for a few months now.

     Pure and true value is created 
     note at the expense of other people animals nor
     the environment, but rather as a way of "lifting
     all boats" as a rising tide does.


     Maintenenance of tools, instruments, machines,
     shelter, etc... is somewhat (though not 
     completely) analagous to the responsibility that comes
     with ownership/care of animals (or even children).

     Rigor


     Ownership is a compromise
         that doesn't really treat the universe 
	 with the respect it deserves.  Rather the 
	 whole idea is too heavily weighted toward
	 an anthropocentric (or at least individualistic)
	 view.


     But nevertheless I am going to assume that the
     concept of ownership will continue to hold sway in much
     of human society for the next few years, decades and/or 
     centuries.

     My goal is to advance the tenet that 
     ownership might better be reframed as responsibility.  If
     human society (and most of the individuals who make up
     our society) can embrace that idea, I believe that 
     much unneeded suffering can be avoided.
