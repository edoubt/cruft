So most everyone "naturally" seeks to control their environment as much as possible.   But this is an instinct more than a rational thought.  And taken to the extreme, it becomes meaningless (or worse, a true negative).

So while a "little bit" of control isn't a bad thing (as long as it's limited), we should really give up on this as a mechanism for change.  Instead we should just act (sometimes against or despite someone else who may be trying to control us) and not try to exert so much control.

Deception is part of human nature.  At least in all the societies I've been exposed to.  How to resolve this obvious conflict of all of us "saying" we value honesty, but then acting dishonestly (at least sometimes)?  Recognizing the fact that we first of all all lie to ourselves (in order to relieve cognitive dissonance and develop a sense of "self") is a good first step, but what next?
