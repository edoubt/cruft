These are "components" or "qualities" that a 
specific gift may or may not have (depending 
on the gift, the giver, receiver and other 
circumstances).  My idea is that one can use 
these to measure or evaluate the gift (and 
compare different gifts to each other).  The 
first (pure) is perhaps more of a composite 
rating of all the others.  I'm also thinking 
of "value" as perhaps subtly different than
purity (though each of them is a dimension 
that may correspond to the "direction" (if 
any) that each individual "quality" may 
correspond with).  The file _quality_ is the 
master list, and each subdirectory will hold
more details on each.
