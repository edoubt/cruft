These are "components" or "qualities" that a 
specific gift may or may not have (depending 
on the gift, the giver, receiver and other 
circumstances).  My idea is that one can use 
these to measure or evaluate the gift (and 
compare different gifts to each other).  The 
first (pure) is perhaps more of a composite 
rating of all the others.
