We often give gifts in order to receive acknowledgement.
In my opinion, this acknowledgement should never be 
expected, as that would make it far more like a purchased
transaction and far less like a true gift.  It *may* be
that we receive profuse thanks for our act of giving,
but really that ought to be seen as a separate (perhaps
mini-) gift given back.  And when the motivation is 
to receive acknowledgement, doesn't that make the gift
somehow less pure?
