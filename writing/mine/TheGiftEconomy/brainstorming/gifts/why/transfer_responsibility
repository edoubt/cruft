In some cases a gift is given in order to relieve
the giver of responsibility or some sort of burden.

This can be positive or negative (or perhaps both).

In the case where the giver knows that s/he is no
longer capable of caring for an object (or perhaps
an animal/plant) properly, the transfer may be made 
(with the best of intentions) hoping that the 
receiver will be able to properly care for the item
(or animal/plant).

In the worst cases of this sort, the receiver of the
"gift" actually gets a heavy burden, without which,
they-s/he may have been better off.  The giver may 
have known that was the case (obviously this means
bad intentions) or perhaps have just been careless
and/or clueless.
