Transparency and openness are powerful tools.  The trick is to keep
them completely voluntary.  But how to do that w/children?  Protecting
children by keeping details about their location, behavior and lives
secret is pretty instinctual.  Which I suppose is another huge issue
in today's world, the fact that so many of us differ on "age of
consent" or "coming of age" details (and few parents are capable
and/or prepared to see a specific birthday as a dividing line between
childhood and adulthood).  We parents are so interested in protecting
our children at any cost, that sometimes this behavior doesn't have
the intended effect



So I currently have an issue due to the way I treat my data (better
than perhaps my family or other tools get treated).  Since I don't
have a reliable desktop on-line at home, I have no place to backup my
most private thoughts.  And so I don't even want to make the effort to
type them in.  Because I want to write about stuff that is more
personal, and doesn't really lend itself to being displayed here on
github.  It's a bit of an issue.  Any answer requires effort
(encryption, setting up (and learning the ins and outs) of a bitbucket
repo, or whatever) and one of the things that's important to me
(apparently -- I don't think I'd explicitly realized this prior to
right now) is that I *do* want to be able to keep some things private.
