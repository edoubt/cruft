some of us consider dogs human as well -- in getting to that point, we've also become (at least a little) dog-like

but I think the cooperative nature of working as a "hunting pack" together originally has since bound our two species tightly 

and of course horse, cat or <animalX> lovers can probably make equally valid arguments for their own cause 

there are both good and bad that have come out of our relationship(s) with dogs

i think one of the worst is the way that it has upheld the myth of power -- by practicing the dominant/submission paradigm (something dogs are quite attuned to), we're losing a huge opportunity to learn how to work *together* in less directed ways
