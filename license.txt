I have clearly identified all of the work of others when I directly include it in this repo (because attribution is the one thing that we must try not to lose in the digital world).  All of the rest (whether prose, or code) is mine.  I do not believe that "rules" about copyright or intellectual property which place restrictions on use by anyone make sense.  Therefore I'm not going to "release" any of this information under any specific license (though that may change for specific subdirectories in the future) or grant.  It's already as free as it needs to be (one of the reasons I settled on github is because it's a very open and accessible platform).  If anyone has a wish for me to grant them a specific license, I would be willing to listen (at least in principle).  Hit me (perhaps over and over?  I'm not that regular with twitter) @ernstdoubt
